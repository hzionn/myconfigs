For example:\n\n```\n# Ignore all files in empty directories\n*\n# But don't ignore .gitkeep files\n!.gitkeep\n```\n\nThis will keep tracking all `.gitkeep` files throughout your repository, regardless of their location in the folder structure.\n\nNote: If you have any parent directories that are ignored, you'll need to also add negation rules for those directories. For example:\n\n```\n# Ignore all files in empty directories\n*\n# Don't ignore directories\n!*/\n# Don't ignore .gitkeep files\n!.gitkeep\n```\n\nThis ensures that Git can traverse through the directories to find the `.gitkeep` files.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":71}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":38},"start":90,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":72}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":39},"start":1105,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":73}}}],"summary":"Ignoring gitkeep Files in Folders","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
