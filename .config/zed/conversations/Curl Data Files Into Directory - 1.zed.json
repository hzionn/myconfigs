Here's how:\n\n1. First, create the data folder if it doesn't exist:\n```bash\nmkdir -p data\n```\n\n2. Then use curl to download into that folder:\n```bash\ncurl -o data/filename.ext URL\n```\n\nFor example, if you're downloading a JSON file:\n```bash\ncurl -o data/data.json https://example.com/data.json\n```\n\nIf you're downloading multiple files, you can do multiple curl commands:\n```bash\ncurl -o data/file1.csv https://example.com/file1.csv\ncurl -o data/file2.json https://example.com/file2.json\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the URLs with the actual URLs you want to download from, and the filenames with what you want to save them as.\n\nWould you like me to help you with a specific URL or file you're trying to download?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":58}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":56,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":59}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":934,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":60}}}],"summary":"Curl Data Files Into Directory","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
