I fail to memorize vim tricks, so I have to write them down...

# Vim Motions

- comment the target block with `#`
    1. highlight the target block
    2. enter vim command mode
    3. then type `s/^/#`

- highlight contents within `()`
    1. type `vi(`
    2. or `vi)`
    3. works also for `{}`, `""`, ...
